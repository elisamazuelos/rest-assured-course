# Automating API tests with REST Assured

Some examples on how to use REST Assured provided by the course: https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automating-your-api-tests-with-rest-assured/

* Chapter 1: simple ``GET`` test that verifies the place given a certain zip code using ``body()`` and ``equalTo``.
* Chapter 2: several ``GET`` tests with different assertions: ``statusCode``, ``contenType``, ``log``, ``hasItem`` and ``hasSize``.
* Chapter 3: a ``GET`` test using parameters with JUnit5's ``@ParameterizedTest``.
* Chapter 4: some ``GET`` tests that use request and response specifications.
* Chapter 5: previous tests made with XML bodies instead of JSON.
